Point of equilibrium  
================  
input: A 2D array, number in that is weight.  
output: The point of equilibrium  

Infect, point of equilibrium means center of gravity. Thus, all need to do is get the weighted arithmetic mean in each direction, row and col.  
Interestingly, in Python, we can do that by only 4 lines of code.
